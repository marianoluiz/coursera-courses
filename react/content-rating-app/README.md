This was initially made for a Lab activity for Module 1 of Coursera React by IBM. I have improved its UI and features in order to make it a better content rating app. ðŸ˜Š

# Content Rating Application

In this project, users can rate a material by clicking 'like' or 'dislike' buttons. When the component is rendered for the first time, both the like and dislike counts are set to zero. The state will add one to the number of likes when a user selects the 'like' button. In the same way, clicking the 'dislike' button, will add one to the number of dislikes. This action lets users rate the content in an interactive way using like or dislike button and provides feedback to content creators.
